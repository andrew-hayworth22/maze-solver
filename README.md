# Maze Solver
A Python application that visualized the generation and solving of two-dimensional mazes using a DFS algorithm.

## Running the solver
To run the test suite, run:
```./test.sh``` 

To run the program, run:
```./main.sh```

## Configuration
To modify the size of the maze, change the values at the top of main.py (beware of the canvas size that is created as it may get wonky with huge maze sizes)
You can customize the colors of the lines along by modifying the config values on the top of maze.py
